Welcome to Critter Sitter App!

Critter Sitter is a communication tool for individuals who live with one or more persons who share responsibility of one or more pets. User’s create a profile, create or join households, add pets to their households, and track pet events, such as ‘walked’ or ‘fed’. User’s can input any type of event they wish and have the option to write notes about the event. Events are timestamped, so other user’s of the household can see when each event happened. 

No more worrying if you pup has been let out by your family, significant other, roommate, or dog walker!
